## Usage
### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. 

Read about [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to understand about routes and how it works. Simple example, template `pages/api/hello.ts` will be available by next URI [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). 

Also this project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
